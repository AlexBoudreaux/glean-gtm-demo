# Netlify Core Positioning

## The Elevator Pitch

Netlify is the essential platform for modern web development. Ship sites and apps faster with a platform that combines CI/CD, serverless functions, and edge delivery in one workflow.

## Key Stats

- 8.5M+ developers
- 140 deploys/week average for enterprise customers
- Powers 10M+ sites globally
- 99.99% uptime SLA for enterprise

---

## Agent Experience (AX) - The Strategic Bet

This is Netlify's forward-looking positioning. Use it for AI-forward companies.

### The Story

AI agents are becoming a new interface for web deployment. Users prompt, agents build, infrastructure hosts. Netlify is positioning itself as the infrastructure layer for this shift.

### Proof Point: Bolt.new

Bolt.new (by StackBlitz) has deployed **1M+ sites** to Netlify via AI agents. Users describe what they want, Bolt generates it, Netlify hosts it. This is "prompt to production" at scale.

### When to Use AX Positioning

- Prospect is building AI/ML products
- Prospect has "agent" or "AI-generated content" features
- Prospect's users create output that needs to be deployed
- Prospect is in the AI tooling space

### Key AX Messages

1. **"Prompt to production"** - From AI-generated content to live URL instantly
2. **"Infrastructure for the agent era"** - As agents create more content, that content needs to live somewhere
3. **"Proven at scale"** - Bolt.new's 1M+ sites shows this works
4. **"Your customers' agents need a home"** - If your product generates web content, Netlify hosts it

### Matt Biilmann Quote (CEO)

> "Too many companies are focusing on adding shallow AI features. The real breakthrough will be thinking about how your customers' favorite agents can help them derive more value from your product."
