# Glean Core Positioning

## The Elevator Pitch

Glean connects to every tool your company uses, builds a knowledge graph of your entire organization, and gives every employee an AI assistant that actually knows your business. Search, assistant, and agents in one platform.

## Key Stats

- $200M ARR (doubled in 9 months)
- $7.2B valuation
- 100+ enterprise connectors
- 27 billion documents indexed
- 40% weekly active / monthly active ratio (2x SaaS industry benchmark)
- 2-3 hours saved per employee per week

---

## Enterprise Search: The Entry Point

This is how most customers first experience Glean. One search box across everything.

### The Story

Enterprise knowledge is scattered across dozens of tools (Slack, Confluence, Google Drive, Salesforce, Jira, Notion, etc.). Employees waste hours switching between systems, asking colleagues, or duplicating work because they can't find what already exists.

### Proof Points

- Confluent: 15,000+ hours/month saved, 70% adoption
- Super.com: 17x ROI, 1,500+ hours/month
- Duolingo: 5x ROI, 500+ hours/month

### When to Lead With Search

- Prospect has 5+ SaaS tools for docs, comms, and collaboration
- Prospect is growing fast (knowledge silos forming)
- Prospect has remote or distributed teams
- Employees complain about not finding information

### Key Search Messages

1. **"One search for everything"**: Slack, Drive, Confluence, Salesforce, Jira, and 100+ more
2. **"Permission-aware"**: Employees only see what they're allowed to see, enforced at the document level
3. **"Works in days, not months"**: Turnkey connectors, no engineering required
4. **"People actually use it"**: 40% wDAU/wMAU ratio proves real adoption, not shelfware

## AI Platform: The Expansion Play

Search gets them in the door. The platform is where the real value (and deal size) grows.

### Three Pillars

**1. Search** - Unified enterprise search across all tools
**2. Assistant** - AI that answers questions using company knowledge (not generic internet data)
**3. Agents** - Autonomous AI that takes actions across connected platforms

### When to Lead With Platform

- Prospect is evaluating AI broadly, not just search
- CIO or Head of AI is the buyer
- Prospect already uses ChatGPT/Copilot but wants AI grounded in their data
- Prospect is building an AI Center of Excellence

### Key Platform Messages

1. **"AI that knows your company"**: Unlike ChatGPT, Glean's answers come from your actual docs, tickets, and conversations
2. **"Search is the foundation, not the ceiling"**: Start with search, expand to agents and custom AI apps
3. **"15+ models, no lock-in"**: Model Hub lets you choose from multiple LLMs, not locked to one vendor
4. **"Enterprise-grade from day one"**: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001

### 5. Speed to Value
- Turnkey connectors, no engineering required
- Up and running in days
- No data migration needed (connects to existing tools)
- High adoption rates without forced rollout

**When to lead with this:** IT teams with limited bandwidth, companies that have been burned by long implementations

### 6. Knowledge Graph (The Moat)
- Enterprise Graph with 60+ signals
