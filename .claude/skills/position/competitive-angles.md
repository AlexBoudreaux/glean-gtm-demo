# Competitive Positioning

How to position Netlify against alternatives. Remember: differentiate, don't bash.

---

## Not Every Conversation is Competitive

Sometimes the opportunity isn't replacing an existing solution. It's filling a gap.

**Examples of non-competitive opportunities:**
- Prospect integrates with Webflow/WordPress but doesn't provide native hosting → Netlify as infrastructure partner
- Prospect's users need to deploy AI-generated content → Netlify as deployment layer
- Prospect is building new features that need hosting → Netlify powers the new capability

In these cases, skip competitive positioning entirely. Focus on the partnership/infrastructure angle.

## vs Vercel

### Key Differentiators
- **Framework flexibility** - Not tied to Next.js, works with any framework
- **Built-in features** - Forms, identity, A/B testing included (not paid add-ons)
- **More generous free tier** - Better for teams starting out
- **Enterprise maturity** - Longer track record with large companies

### Messaging Approach
- Don't bash Vercel directly
- "Netlify works great with Next.js too, without framework lock-in"
- "Built-in features mean fewer third-party integrations to manage"
- "Many teams use both. Netlify gives you flexibility as your needs evolve."

### When They Say...

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're on Vercel" | "Many teams use both. Netlify gives you flexibility to use any framework as your needs evolve." |
| "Vercel is better for Next.js" | "We have deep Next.js support too. DocuSign runs their Next.js sites on Netlify at enterprise scale." |
| "We need SSR/ISR" | "Netlify supports SSR and ISR. Plus our edge functions let you run logic closer to users globally." |

## vs AWS Amplify

### Key Differentiators
- **Dramatically simpler** - No AWS complexity to navigate
- **Faster time to deploy** - Minutes not hours
- **Less ops overhead** - Focus on code, not infrastructure
- **Better DX** - Deploy previews, intuitive dashboard

### Messaging Approach
- "All the power, none of the AWS complexity"
- "Your developers will thank you"
- "Ship in minutes instead of configuring for hours"

### When They Say...

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're already in AWS" | "Netlify integrates with your AWS backend. You get better DX for the frontend without leaving AWS entirely." |
| "AWS Amplify is cheaper" | "Total cost includes dev time. Our customers save significant engineering hours compared to managing Amplify." |

## vs Cloudflare Pages

### Key Differentiators
- **More mature** - Longer track record, fuller feature set
- **Better DX** - More intuitive for most web development use cases
- **Stronger ecosystem** - Integrations, plugins, community
- **Built-in features** - Forms, identity, etc. that Cloudflare lacks

### Messaging Approach
- "Purpose-built for web development"
- "Cloudflare Pages is relatively new; Netlify has been refining this for years"
- "Our ecosystem of integrations and plugins is more mature"

---

## vs WordPress/Webflow (Indirect Competition)

Sometimes we're not replacing WordPress or Webflow. We're complementing them or filling a gap they leave.

### The Gap Angle
- "WordPress/Webflow are great for full websites"
- "But for quick landing pages, campaign pages, or AI-generated content, setting up a CMS is overkill"
- "Netlify offers instant deployment without the CMS overhead"

### When They Already Integrate With Webflow/WordPress
- Don't position as replacement
- Position as "for the use cases that don't need a full CMS"
- "Your users who need quick pages shouldn't have to set up Webflow"

## General Objection Handlers

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're happy with our current setup" | "That's great. Many teams start exploring Netlify when they need to scale or want to ship faster. Worth keeping in mind." |
| "It's too expensive" | "Have you seen our free tier? And our enterprise customers often see cost savings. Citrix saved 65%." |
| "We need [specific feature]" | [Check if Netlify has it. Often they do and prospect doesn't know.] |
| "Our devs prefer X framework" | "Netlify works with any framework. Your devs can use whatever they're comfortable with." |
| "We need SSO/compliance" | "Netlify is SOC 2 Type II certified with SSO support for enterprise customers." |
| "What about vendor lock-in?" | "Your code stays in your git repo. Netlify doesn't lock you in. If you leave, you take everything with you." |

## Competitor Detection to Positioning

| Current Platform | Positioning Angle |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Vercel | Framework flexibility, built-in features, no lock-in |
| AWS Amplify | Simplicity, better DX, faster deploys |
| Cloudflare Pages | Maturity, ecosystem, full feature set |
| Self-hosted | Managed platform, focus on code not infrastructure |
| Traditional hosting | Modern workflow, Deploy Previews, edge delivery |
| WordPress/Webflow (integration) | Fill the gap for lightweight deployments |
| None (greenfield) | Full platform benefits, AX story if AI-forward |

## When NOT to Compete

If the prospect already has a solid hosting solution and is happy with it, don't force a competitive conversation.

Instead, look for:
- **Adjacent opportunities** - New products or features that need hosting
- **Gap filling** - Use cases their current solution doesn't cover
- **Partnership** - Could Netlify power something new for them?

The Jasper/Bolt.new angle is a good example: not "replace Webflow" but "power the use cases Webflow doesn't cover."
