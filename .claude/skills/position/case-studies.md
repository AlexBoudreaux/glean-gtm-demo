## Matching Logic

When selecting a case study, prioritize in this order:

1. **Same industry** - Fintech prospect → fintech case study
2. **Same pain point** - Cost concerns → Citrix regardless of industry
3. **Same scale** - High-growth startup → VMware Tanzu
4. **Same technical situation** - AI features → Bolt.new

Never use a case study just because the metric is impressive. It must be **relevant** to the prospect's situation.
