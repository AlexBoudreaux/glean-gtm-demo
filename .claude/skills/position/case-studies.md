## Matching Logic

When selecting a case study, prioritize in this order:

1. **Same industry** - Fintech prospect gets Wealthsimple or Super.com
2. **Same pain point** - ROI concerns get Super.com (17x) regardless of industry
3. **Same scale** - Large enterprise gets Confluent or Booking.com
4. **Same buying objection** - Adoption concerns get Upside (92%)

Never use a case study just because the metric is impressive. It must be **relevant** to the prospect's situation.
