## Structures to Avoid

### Binary Contrasts
These create false drama. Just state the point.

**Avoid:**
- "Not because X. Because Y."
- "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is."
- "The answer isn't X. It's Y."
- "It's not this. It's that."

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y."

**Example:**
- Bad: "Not because the technology is complex. Because people are complex."
- Good: "Technology is manageable. People aren't."

### Dramatic Fragmentation
Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

**Avoid:**
- "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]."
- "X. And Y. And Z."
- "This unlocks something. [Word]."

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

**Example:**
- Bad: "Speed. Quality. Cost. You can only pick two."
- Good: "Speed, quality, cost. Pick two."

### Rhetorical Setups
These announce insight rather than deliver it.

**Avoid:**
- "What if [reframe]?"
- "Here's what I mean:"
- "Think about it:"
- "And that's okay."

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

### Punchy One-Liners
If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it.

**Avoid:**
- "The last mile to the web is friction, not magic."
- "Agents that create without deploying are only half the story."
- "This isn't about hosting. It's about completing the loop."

**Instead:** Say it plain.
- "Publishing is still manual and error-prone."
- "Agents create content but can't deploy it."
- "Netlify handles deployment so they don't have to."

## Rhythm Rules

1. **Vary sentence length.** Two items beat three. Not everything needs parallel structure.

2. **Don't stack punchy fragments.** One short sentence is emphasis. Three is a pattern.

3. **Break metronomic rhythm.** If three sentences are the same length, vary one.

4. **Vary paragraph endings.** Don't always end with a punchy one-liner.

## Quick Checklist

Before delivering copy, check:

- [ ] Three consecutive sentences match length? Break one.
- [ ] Paragraph ends with punchy one-liner? Vary it.
- [ ] Em-dash before a reveal? Remove it.
- [ ] Listing three benefits? Cut to two.
- [ ] Using passive voice? Find the actor.
- [ ] Hedging with "may"? Commit or cut.
- [ ] Sounds like a LinkedIn post? Rewrite.
- [ ] Would a person actually say this? If not, simplify.

## The Test

Read your copy out loud. If it sounds like a TED talk or a motivational poster, it's too AI. Good sales copy sounds like a smart person explaining something clearly.
