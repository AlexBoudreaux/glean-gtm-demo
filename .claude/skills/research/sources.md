# Research Sources Guide

Where to look and what each source reveals.

---

## Primary Sources (Always Check)

### Company Website
- `/about` - Company description, mission, team size, leadership
- `/careers` or `/jobs` - Tech stack hints, growth signals, team structure
- `/blog` - Recent launches, technical decisions, company direction
- `/press` or `/news` - Announcements, funding, partnerships
- `/integrations` - What other tools they connect to (important for understanding tool landscape)

### Product Documentation
- `/docs` or `docs.company.com` - How the product actually works
- API documentation - Technical capabilities, what developers can build
- Help center - User workflows, how teams collaborate
- Changelog - Recent features, what they're investing in

### LinkedIn
- Company page - Employee count, recent hires, growth rate
- Key people - CTO, VP Engineering, VP IT, Head of Knowledge Management
- Job postings - Tech requirements reveal stack and priorities

### Job Postings
Check these sites for tech stack and priority clues:
- LinkedIn Jobs
- Greenhouse (company.greenhouse.io)
- Lever (jobs.lever.co/company)
- Ashby (jobs.ashbyhq.com/company)
- Company careers page directly

**What to look for in job postings:**
- Required technologies (reveals current stack)
- Team descriptions (reveals org structure and scale)
- Scale indicators ("millions of users", "thousands of employees")
- IT/knowledge management roles (signals pain around information access)
- AI-related roles (signals interest in AI adoption)

## Required Checks

### BuiltWith.com (Always Check)
**This is required, not optional.** Go to builtwith.com/[company-domain] to see:
- SaaS tools in use (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Analytics and marketing tools
- Internal tooling signals
- This reveals what systems they've already committed to

### G2 / Capterra / Glassdoor (Always Check)
Search for the company on G2.com and Capterra.com for product reviews, and Glassdoor for employee reviews. Look specifically for:
- Complaints about finding information or knowledge management
- Friction mentioned around tool sprawl or too many systems
- Onboarding pain points
- Collaboration and communication challenges
- This reveals pain points employees and users actually feel

---

## Secondary Sources

### News & Press
- Google News search: "[company name] funding" or "[company name] AI"
- Crunchbase - Funding history, investors, company timeline
- TechCrunch - Coverage of funding rounds and launches
- Company blog - Often has the most detailed announcements

### Industry Coverage
- G2 - Enterprise software reviews, competitor comparisons
- Product Hunt - Launch history, positioning
- Twitter/X - Company announcements, executive commentary
- YouTube - Product demos, conference talks

## What Each Source Reveals

| Source | Reveals |
|--------|---------|
| Careers page | Tech stack, team size, growth priorities |
| Job postings | Specific technologies, org structure |
| Product docs | How the product works, customer workflows |
| Integrations page | Ecosystem dependencies, tool landscape |
| LinkedIn | Employee count, hiring velocity, key people |
| BuiltWith | Current SaaS tools, infrastructure choices |
| Crunchbase | Funding stage, investors, runway |
| Blog/changelog | Product direction, recent bets |

## Knowledge-Specific Sources

When trying to understand their knowledge and search challenges:

1. **Integrations page** - What collaboration and docs tools do they use?
2. **Careers page** - Are they hiring IT, knowledge management, or internal tools roles?
3. **Glassdoor reviews** - Do employees mention difficulty finding information?
4. **Technical blog posts** - Have they written about internal tooling or knowledge management?
5. **Company size and growth rate** - Fast-growing companies have the worst knowledge silos

## Red Flags and Opportunity Signals

### Red Flags (May Not Be Good Prospect)
- Already a vocal Microsoft Copilot or competitor customer (recently deployed)
- Very small company (under 50 employees, likely don't need enterprise search)
- No SaaS tool diversity (everything in one suite, less fragmentation pain)

### Opportunity Signals
- Uses 5+ different SaaS tools for docs, comms, and collaboration (fragmentation)
- Rapid hiring (50+ open roles, knowledge transfer pain)
- Remote or distributed workforce (harder to find info without unified search)
- Recent acquisition or merger (massive knowledge integration challenge)
- Enterprise customer base (needs permission-aware search)
- Mentions AI adoption in blog or press (forward-thinking, open to AI tools)
- Using legacy intranet or SharePoint (ripe for modernization)
- Hiring knowledge management or internal tools roles (actively feeling the pain)
