# Stop Slop

Eliminate predictable AI writing patterns from prose. AI inflates everything. If every sentence sounds pivotal, readers switch off. Write like a person who knows what they mean.

## Core Rules

1. **Cut filler phrases.** Remove throat-clearing openers and emphasis crutches. See [references/phrases.md](references/phrases.md).

2. **Break formulaic structures.** Avoid binary contrasts, dramatic fragmentation, rhetorical setups. See [references/structures.md](references/structures.md).

3. **Vary rhythm.** Mix sentence lengths. Two items beat three. End paragraphs differently. Real writing is uneven.

4. **Trust readers.** State facts directly. Skip softening, justification, hand-holding.

5. **Cut quotables.** If it sounds like a pull-quote, rewrite it.

6. **Use "I" and "you".** Passive voice makes writing distant. Active voice sounds human.

7. **Take a stance.** Replace "may potentially" with a clear claim you can defend.

8. **Be concrete.** Specifics sound human. Vague claims sound automated.

9. **Format sparingly.** Use bold and spacing as emphasis, not as a template.

10. **Delete filler conclusions.** If the point is clear, do not restate it.

## Quick Checks

Before delivering prose:

- Three consecutive sentences match length? Break one.
- Paragraph ends with punchy one-liner? Vary it.
- Em-dash before a reveal? Remove it.
- Explaining a metaphor? Trust it to land.
- Listing three benefits? Cut to two or one.
- Using passive voice? Find the actor.
- Hedging with "may" or "potentially"? Commit or cut.
- Repeating your point in the conclusion? Delete the restatement.

## Scoring

Rate 1-10 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human? |
| Density | Anything cuttable? |
| Concreteness | Specifics or vague claims? |
| Voice | Active with clear actors? |

Below 50/70: revise.
